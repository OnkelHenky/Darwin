# Darwin
Note: This is a prototypical implementation to conduct some experiments for the further development of a JavaScript framework for adaptive Web Components  with GPII support. This version is debrecated and no more maintained. The main concepts have been migrated to the [AWC-Core framework](https://github.com/FraunhoferIAO/awc-core).

## Description

## Usage
A brief introduction of how to use Darwin in its current state by running the Darwin_Testbed, can be found
in the readme file of PinotNoir - a test tool, which simulates the GPII flowmanager [https://github.com/REMEXLabs/Darwin/tree/master/PinotNoir](https://github.com/REMEXLabs/Darwin/tree/master/PinotNoir).
